"""Shared authorization gate for by-id media content routes.

Maps, tokens, and audio each expose `/{id}`, `/{id}/file`, and thumbnail/artwork
routes that serve content by bare id. Library *browsing* is blocked for guests
(`require_not_guest` on the list routes), but these by-id routes stay open so a
resource shared into a guest's campaign still renders. That means each handler
must authorise the caller itself, exactly as the book content routes do.

This mirrors `backend.routers.books._helpers._assert_book_access`, generalised
across media types via the resource-type dispatch in `user_can_access_resource`.
